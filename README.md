# Overview
* A traffic simulation was created as a project in two half-days by four people during the MCNet school.
* For the programming of the traffic simulation the Python (“"Python" is a registered trademark of the Python Software Foundation”) language was used together with some additional python modules.
* The simulation can be started by typing python traffic.py

# Features
* Up to now traffic on four or n lanes is simulated.
* Two different kinds of car models are used - one simple car and one car with lane changing and overtaking possibilities.
* During the simulation a single ambulance car is simulated which frees its own lane and makes sure that all cars change to other lanes.
* The amount of cars can be given by using -n while their behaviour is partly randomly defined in the beginning.
* Some car crash detection is handling is implemented.
* During the simulation different sound effects are played.
* The Python Pandas module is used for a basic logging of car traffic behaviour and show figures are show after the traffic simulation has finished.
